# Programming Lessons

This repo contains a collection of files designed to help people learn:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (& npm)
* Python (& pip)
* Git - useful commands
* Terminal commands - cheatsheet

Each of the above topics should be considered as a module to learn (the order is not so important, but I've created it this way as I feel it will be the most efficient way to learn in my opinion).

## Description of each module

Below is a description of each of the modules to provide context:

### HTML
HyperText Mark-up Language

### CSS
### Javascript
### Python
### Git
